This repository contains the source files and the assets of the PDA driver i developed for my Thesis:

"Fabrication of a photodiode sensor system using the BeagleBone microcomputer for use in non-invasive biomedical sensors"

The aim of the thesis, is the fabrication of a photodiode sensor system that will be able to extract and store samples, taken with non-invasive methods from the patientâ€™s fingers.

BeagleBone Black is the the target platform.
The PDA is TSL1401CL by ams.

The folder SGK_PDA should be copied inside the folder /home/Debian.
